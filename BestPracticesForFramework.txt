Best practices for creating a framework from scratch :
---------------------------------------------------------
(i) Create dependency management project like Maven
(ii) Add all the required dependencies in the maven's pom.xml
(iii) The testing framework should have well defined packages like, 
	Pages - where page classes reside
	Test - where test reside
	Utilities -  Where classes containing utility methods reside
(iv) Each page should have a seperate Page class and a corresponding Test class.
(v) The test data should not be hard coded in the test methods. Instead they should be maintained in a seperate file like excel or congig files.
(vi) We can create a seperate Object repository for the WebElements used throughout the application.
(vii) The Base class that instantiates the driver, utility classes, Page classes, test data files, config files should be under src/main/java
(viii) The Test class should under src/test/java
(ix) All the reusable parts of the code should be placed in the Utility class.
(x) We can have a seperate folder to save the generated reports.
(xi) Good naming conventions should be used for the variables, methods, classes and packages.
(xii) Use appropriate Design patterns and principles to design the framework.
(xiii) We can have seperate folder in our project to save our failed test case's screenshots.
